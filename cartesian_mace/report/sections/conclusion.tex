It is non-trivial and useful step forward to have CMACE in the literature as the first many-body equivariant model with Cartesian tensors of arbitrary rank. This project has produced the code for CMACE neatly split up into discrete modules and unlike MACE does not use any esoteric python packages allowing for anyone with a grasp of PyTorch to get a model up and running very quickly. This simplicity also allows for the easy addition novel modifications to CMACE that have not yet been thought of. The experiments have shown the same theoretical properties as MACE in the $k$-chains and rotational symmetry experiments suggesting strong expressive power. Though expressivity is just one side of the story, there is future to be work done in optimising this model for benchmarking.
