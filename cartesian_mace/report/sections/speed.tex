\begin{itemize}
    \item we decided that a main thing was to look at the inference speed of CMACE vs MACE due to computational complexity of CG contraction $O(N^6)$
    \item show that overall they were of similar speed due to so inefficiencies of the CMACE model that could be done (but this wasn't the point of the project)
    \item test the speed of the contractions and how they grow with different h, max\_ell and atomic basis 
\end{itemize}

One of the motivations for this experiment was that calculating tensor products is very expensive, $\O(L^6)$ where $L$ is the order of the representation, this is due to the need to calculate the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients **. The Cartesian basis on the other hand has scales the same way but cheaper or scales different? 

Therefore, it is important to consider the speed differences between the two architectures both at the level of the tensor contraction and also model-wide. It is also important to see how these speed scales with the number of layers, maximum correlation order $\nu$, and maximum order $L$ (of representations i.e. $Y^m_\ell, r^{\otimes \ell}$.
